# The Locker #

*In darkness it lurks, seeks light and sense and only responds with hunger.*

A new and unique enemy/hazard that responds to player's vision much like a coilhead but with a few twists.

## Behavior ##

The locker is a bit of a different enemy in that it represents more of a possible future obstacle when encountered as an experienced player. At the same time its purpose is to bring back an extra element of surprise and dynamic to the gameplay through unannounced encounters, similar to a coil head without the permanent danger and caveats that come with it.

Just like the hydrogene is not much of a threat, having it coupled with other enemies increases its difficulty. Additionally, I want to create new and dynamic situations much like those found in the base game caused by coil heads, spiders and hydrogenes roaming. As such this enemy is designed with that in mind.

**Further details about its behaviour can be found below - keep in mind if you're looking for something new to be surprised, these are a spoiler**

<details> 
  <summary>Behavior Details:</summary>

- The locker activates and charges at a player if they scan it having a clear line to the player up to a range of 90 meters
- Activating from a scan has to propagate to the locker and matches the scan wave you see in game
- At a maximum range of 90 meters it will take 3 seconds before activating
- The locker responds to player flashlights when aimed at it and will charge at players even if the flashlight is lit in an offhand slot
- The locker responds to player touch meaning getting stuck with it in a corner is generally a death sentence
- The locker responds to held light sources in a 15 meter range
- Crouching past the locker will not alert it
- The locker can be stood on without activating it
- Players caught in the charge are instantly killed
- The locker can not be killed/destroyed by regular means
- The locker can kill enemies while chasing
- The locker can crush and destroy doors while chasing
- The locker can crush and destroy turrets while chasing
- The locker explodes mines it runs over while chasing
- Crashing two lockers together will cause an explosion
- The locker has a chance to reactivate after a chase and close in on the closest player - the chance of this happening is 50% by default and can be configured
