# The Locker #

*In darkness it lurks, seeks light and sense and only responds with hunger.*

A new and unique enemy that responds to player's vision much like a coilhead but with a few twists.

## Behavior ##

The locker is a bit of a different enemy in that it represents more of an obstacle when encountered as an experienced player. At the same time it's purpose is to bring back fear and shock to the gameplay, similar to a coil head without impacting gameplay as much on its own.

While the coilhead is a foe that is constantly seeking out the player, the locker is much more of a hindrance that becomes a grave situational threat when combined with other enemies.

## To-do ##

- Fix any bugs people encounter
- Fix map screen marker switching to enemy layer (disabled for now)
- Fix collision not firing when the player touches enemy
- Implement bestiary entry
- Add spawn rarity with specification by level
- Visual tweaks
