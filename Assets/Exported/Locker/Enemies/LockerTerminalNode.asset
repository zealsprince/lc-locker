    Although
    it doesn''t hold up to the normal organic miscreations found within the company
    records and might give you pause as to its phylum; the locker as it is referred
    to appears to have been created from both organic and inorganic forms of matter.
    Its strange otherworldly visage made out of an alien alloy appears to be a watcher
    of sorts, praying on those trying to find their way.


    It''s innate and uncanny
    perception of both sense and awareness in itself might be a symptom of those
    it has taken within itself to the shared grave it holds.


    Curiously, it
    has reacted to the most fine tuned of equipment even at long ranges. Any touch,
    signal and light it can sense appears to engage its unstoppable hunger.
